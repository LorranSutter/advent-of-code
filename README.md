# 🎄 Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to December 25th, featuring daily programming puzzles of varying difficulty.

## Running Solutions

You can run the solutions in two ways:

### As a Python Module

```bash
python3 -m 2025.day01.main
```

### As a Script
```bash
python3 ./2025/day01/main.py
```

Replace `2025` with the desired year and `day01` with the specific day you want to run.
